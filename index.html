            <p>I graduated from Cal State, Northridge back in 2014 with a degree in computer engineering. For the past 5 years I have been working as an electronic technician in Sherman Oaks. I am currently transioning into the web development field. My ultimate dream job would be to work for a large corportion such as Microsoft. At this moment I want to be given the opportunity to get into the field so any job is fine with me.</p>
            <p>I am married and have a 2 year old daughter. I love to spend time with my family whether it be playing with my daughter or going to see a movie with my wife. I also like to travel with them. We recently went to my wife's home country of El Salvador. Getting a better job in web development will allow me to have more travel adventures with my wife and daughter.</p>
